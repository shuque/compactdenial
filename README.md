# compactrcode
Small library to work with Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC.

The Compact Denial of Existence method is defined in the following
Internet draft, which will be published as an RFC in the near
future:

    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence/

At the current time, Cloudflare and NS1 are known to implement the NXNAME
distinguisher described in the draft that allows precise identification of
non-existent domains.
